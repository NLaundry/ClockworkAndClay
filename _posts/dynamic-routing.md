# THRONE

We sired life
in bronze and steam
and lured in
our clockwork Eve

When this
the child of man
claims its patricidal throne
we'll wonder how
we failed to learn
from the Gods that came before us

# ORCHARDS

Who of us
will learn to breathe
the smoke and steam
that rises
form the orchards
of Turing's Eden

# OLYMPUS

the flame for man
the bolt for you

when you've stolen
for your children
what will be left 
between their Athens
and your Olympus?

# KNOW
When we fed the apple
to silicon and steel
what right have we
to ask it
how it came to know?

# IMAGE
Ichor to iron then oil
flesh to clay to copper
what have we lost 
in the image of an image?
What are you but the shadow of a shadow?

# RELIC
When our promethean pursuit is complete
and we've fashioned a likeness of our own
will we be elevated - Man to God?
will we be relegated - toy to relic?
